Today the group met for the first time.

The session was all about getting to know eachother and starting to spark ideas on what project we want to do.

After everyone introduced themselves it's clear that we are 4 people with different backgrounds, skill-sets and gaming experience. I think the mix of skills will be crucial for the sucess of this project.

We decided to schedule a longer brainstorming session later this week. Until then, everyone should start thinking about ideas they want to do for the project.
