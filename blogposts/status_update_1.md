Implemented a dialouge system. this will be a huge part of the game as most of the story will be told through dialouge and monolouge.

We also presented some of competitor analysis that we have done. Among others we have been paying special attention to:

- [Florence](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102130/Florence/)

- [That dragon cancer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/419460/That_Dragon_Cancer/)

- [When the past was around](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1164050/When_The_Past_Was_Around/)

We will continue with this as the competitor analysis is something we need for the GDD.
