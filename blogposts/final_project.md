We are done with the project. Here's an overview of our final deliverables.

Within the scope of DH2650 me and my team have developed a game called Fragments. Fragments is a story-driven exploration-based casual indie game.

You play the main charachter who in a very abrupt way got broken up with by their partner. The games revolevs around collecting memory tokens with the goal of figuring out why your partner broke up with you.

The game is a 2D pixel art game, played in top-down view.
Some of the features in the game include:

### Exploring levels,

Each level represents a place where significant parts of the relationship took place:

### Interacting with NPC's.

To collect memory tokens you sometimes need to inteact with NPC's such as the dog below. The NPC's will give you tasks to perform in order to retireve the memory tokens.

### Gather memory tokens

Each Memory token represents a significant memory from the relationship. the player needs to decide whether they think it might help them explain why their partner left, or, if they should let go of it.
