Lately I've been working on the dialouge the first level. Or at least for the _slice_ of the first level that we will implement for our demo.

It's been pretty fun to dust of my middle-school story telling skills. But I will be the first to admit, that even though I'm doing my best, this geam won't win an awars for best script, nor best story.

**here's a short example dialogue from an argument between the main charachter Max and his partner Maya:**

**Max:** I’m having dinner with my parent’s this weekend. I was thinking maybe you would like to come this time?

**Maya:** I don’t know, I still think it’s a bit too early to meet your parents maybe ?

**Max:** Nah I don’t think so, it’s not such a big deal and I know they would be so happy to meet you.

**Maya:** But it is a big deal for me! I just think it feels so serious to meet your parents already.

**Max:** But that’s what you said two months ago. when will be a good time to meet them?

**Maya:** I don’t know?! I’ll be ready when I’m ready. Why do you have to rush it so much?

**Max:** I’m not rushing! we’ve been together for almost a year. And it’s importnt for me that you meet them.

**Maya:** But don’t you want me to feel comfortable before meeting them ?

**Max:** Well of course I do, but I feel like you are completely uninterested in my family .

**Maya:** Fine! I will meet them. just not this weekend, I have other plans.

I've also been working on the GDD. And woah! it's a LOT of things to write. Good thing We have almost two weeks to go until it needs to be finished.
