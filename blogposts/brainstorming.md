Today we met up to brainstorm some ideas for our project.

Since last time everyone had gotten the task of coming up with 1-3 ideas.

We went around the table to pitch our ideas to eachother, and added all of them to [this](https://www.figma.com/file/OWmRGWgFltCkIXsW3kgzgv/computer-game-design-group-12-concept-and-planning?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=ZqB3wPzeDFBGco3P-0) Figjam board.

Here's what it looked like: ![brainstorm](/images/brainstorming.png)

After many rounds of discussion we ended up with the idea currently holding the working name **"Fragments"**

In short, the game is a a love story where the Player navigate the main character through each level, avoiding obstacles and solving puzzles that represent his clinging memories of his partner. The goal is to reach a "core memory" in each level and decide whether to erase it or preserve it. Depending on what memories the player keeps and discards, the ending of the game will be different.

We still haven't figured out the details yet and the stortelling will work exactly.
Over the easter week-end everyone will seek inspiration and try to pin down the game mechanics in more detail.
