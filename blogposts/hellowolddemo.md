Today we presented the first version of our project to the class.

As I described in the last post, we have been struggling quite a bit with figuring out how our game should work. Even though all of those issues aren't sorted yet, we managed to pull an MVP together displaying some parts that we know will be in there.

### The MVP

Built in Unity with assets from the Asset Store and scripts for character movement and token collection.

Here's what it looks like as of now: ![the game at hello world demo](/images/game.png)

We received a bunch of questions regarding the gameplay, and some good advice on how to structure our 2D levels to make them more engaging.

I got good advice from a fellow classmate on tools that are good for making 2D sprites, Aseprite among others.

Here's almost the entire group, an excited bunch.
