We have met up several times, probably around four, to brainstorm on game mechanics and storytelling. It feels like we are going in circles.

We've tried to draw inspiration from other narrative-driven games such as _Florence_, _When the Past Was Around_, and _To the Moon_. These sessions have helped us understand different approaches to storytelling and gameplay integration, but deciding on our unique path has been challenging.

### Current Challenges

- **Game Mechanics**: One of our biggest hurdles is figuring out what the player actually does in each level. We're still deciding on how to integrate meaningful actions that drive the story forward.
- **Storyline**: Crafting a love story that resonates with players is crucial. We're brainstorming ways to make our narrative engaging and credible.
- **Memory Game Mechanic**: We want to include a mechanic where players can discard or save memories. This needs to be a significant part of the game to affect the storytelling deeply.
- **Multiple Endings**: We are exploring how the memories players choose to keep can influence different endings. This adds complexity as we need to ensure each potential ending is fulfilling and coherent.

### Group Dynamics

The whole group is stressed and a bit frustrated about not moving forward quickly enough. Although progress is slow, we are making some headway. We have attempted to clarify the division of workload, detailing who is responsible for what aspects of the game. It looks like I will be taking on a significant role in developing the storytelling.
