Since last time we have done lots of thinking on how the Level structure and gameplay of our game should be. Wh have come up with a hook, and Me and Johannes spent 2 long sessions on writing the story for the first level together.

### About the hook

We have come up with a hook that we think will grab the player's attention and motivate them to finish the first level.
Here's a snippet of the back story, including the hook.

_One day, on their regular morning run in the park, our main character spots a person so cute they have to stop and ask for their number. A courageous act that will be a pivotal moment for the rest of their life. The two fall in love, becomebecomes a couple and move in together. Like every couple they share the good and the bad in life, they are different in many ways but share the same sense of humor, and a longing for that one big love. Everything isn’t a smooth sail, like every couple they have fights and disagree on things, but overall things seem to be going well. Until one day, when our main character comes home from work only to discover a note on the kitchen table saying, “I can’t do this anymore. Sorry, I have to leave”._

### About the levels

So we have setteled for having 3 levels in the game, and that each level should have about 7 memory tokens. A memory token represents an important memory from the relationship, it can be a good one, a bad one, or something inbetween. the memory tokens will be placed throughout the level, some will be really easy to find and some will be difficult, requiring NPC interaction and doing some quests.

Together me and Johannes have finally finished the story for the memory tokens of the first level. here's an example:

#### Easy Token 1: The book.

**Task:** Simply need to click on the book that is lying somewhere in the park. On click, you receive the backstory of the memory as well as the token.

**Memory:** The book you found happens to be your partner's favorite. She asked you several times to read it but you couldn’t be bothered. Holding it now, you're reminded of missed connections and unfulfilled promises.

**Token:** The book

This might sound a bit complex, and you might wonder how the player will understand what to do. We have also come up with a solution to that. In each level we will have an authority charachter that you engage with the first thing you do.
