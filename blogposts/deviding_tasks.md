To work more efficiently we have decided to split up the work a little.
From Now Me an Johannes wil focus on the story aspects of our game, while Tianyi, Alaina and Yilei will do developer work in Unity.
I'm happy to be focusing more on the story aspects as we have quite a lot of stuff to write both for the dema and for the GDD.

This was a short little update, but I still wanted to make it as it sets the tone for the rest of the project work.
