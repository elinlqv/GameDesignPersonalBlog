I just got off from a really good supervision session over zoom whith Christopher Peters.
we have been struggeling a lot with getting the story right, and figuring out how to make a user want to replay the game. It feels a bit like we have been moving in cirkles. But this session cleared some things, My main take aways are these two:

- In the demo, people will only have time to play a small part of the game,
- Because of that that small part needs to have a strong hook.
