We made it all the way to the final presentation! YAY!

Me and Johannes presented infront of the class, and I think it went well, but I'm quite reliefed it's over to be honest.

Here are some example slides:

After that, we went on to the demo, Alaina and Tianyi joined to help. We got some really good insights from that.
